Description: This package ports MHM and CMP approaches 
    to R since the initial Java programs are no longer maintained. They are essentially thin wrappers 
    on top of terra package functions and stick to original Gaucherel's implementation while 
    allowing easy customization, inspection and tweaking at every step. Both MHM and CMP propose a methodology to capture the local and scaling variations 
    of landscapes, or anything that can be turned into rasters. MHM works on a single raster, while CMP 
    works on a pair of rasters. Both use moving windows and summary functions to end up with several rasters, 
    one per window size, that are eventually combined, using a custom function, 
    and summarized using a scaling profile plot.
